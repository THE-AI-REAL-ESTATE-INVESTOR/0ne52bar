# Scripts Directory Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup and organization of the scripts directory for the ONE-52 Bar & Grill web application. The goal was to create a structured, well-documented scripts directory that clearly separates development-only scripts from production scripts.

## Actions Taken

### Directory Structure Creation

Created a logical directory structure to organize scripts by purpose:

- `database/` - Scripts for database operations and migrations
- `dev-only/` - Scripts that should only be used in development
- `documentation/` - Scripts for generating documentation
- `production/` - Scripts that may be needed in production
- `schema-management/` - Scripts for managing Prisma schema
- `testing/` - Scripts for testing setup and execution

### Duplicate Removal

Identified and removed duplicate scripts:

1. Removed `database/migrate-members.js` (kept `migrate-members-to-prisma.ts`)
2. Removed `dev-only/prisma-fix.js` (kept `prisma-integration.ts`)
3. Removed `documentation/generate-diagrams.mjs` (kept `generate-diagrams.ts`)

### Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation:

1. Created a detailed `README.md` with:
   - Directory structure explanation
   - Script categorization tables
   - Usage guidelines
   - Production deployment considerations
   - Maintenance instructions

2. Created `.cursorrules` with guidelines for:
   - Script organization
   - Development best practices
   - Production considerations
   - Documentation requirements

### New Tools

Created a utility script to help maintain the scripts directory:

- `dev-only/find-duplicate-scripts.js` - Identifies duplicate or similar scripts to prevent redundancy

## Results

The scripts directory is now:

1. **Well-organized** - Scripts are logically grouped by purpose
2. **Well-documented** - Clear documentation on what each script does
3. **Production-ready** - Clear separation between development and production scripts
4. **Maintainable** - Guidelines in place for future script additions

## Next Steps

1. Continue to follow the established directory structure for new scripts
2. Periodically run the duplicate script finder to prevent redundancy
3. Keep the README updated as new scripts are added
4. Consider adding more automated tests for critical scripts
