Aye, me lucky friends! It’s that time o’ year when we paint the town GREEN, and I—Shamrock Shandy—am invitin’ ya to the biggest St. Paddy’s Day bash in Mustang!
🎉 Monday, March 17 | Kicks off at 12 PM 🎉
Come raise a pint with me mates Jamie & Melissa behind the bar, servin’ up all the Irish cheer ye can handle! But don’t be showin’ up without wearin’ green, or ye just might find yourself on the wrong end of a pinch! 😜
🍻 Drinks flowin’ all day! 🍻
☘️ Green Beer – ‘cause what’s St. Paddy’s Day without it?
🥃 Jameson Shots – smooth as an Irish jig!
🍏 Irish Apple – a crisp & tasty kick!
🍹 Irish Trash Can – for those feelin’ extra lucky!
☕ Irish Coffee – if ye need a lil’ pick-me-up!
🎯 Entertainment for the night! 🎶
🏆 Pool & Darts – test yer luck, or yer skill!
🎶 – so ye can dance like no one’s watchin’!
🎊 Good Times – guaranteed!
So grab yer green, bring yer friends, and let’s make memories that’ll last ‘til next year (or at least ‘til the Jameson wears off)!
See ye there! 🍀🍻
