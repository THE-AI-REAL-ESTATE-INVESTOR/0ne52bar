THis is the Whats working folder it should before every git push be updated the things you will update are. 

Allways cscan scripts to help you if you need help updating this file this file nbeeds to be accurate based on code. it needs to have a clear implemnation mermaid digrams and clear exapmples of why it is working no guessing use tools like "chokidar": "^4.0.3",



#1. - whats-working(title-date-(no guessing use or buiold function))

#2. status.md 

#3. USER_FLOW.md 

#4. A FULL WHAts-working-md(versionerd like github do not guess use code version properly)


THe flow is this we build 

/plans 
/issues - versionsed -date
/once complete they go into issues/completed -date
/after testing they go into /whats-working(title-ofissue) (version)-date
/append to MASTER_WHATS_WORKING.md 

THe master is a real life snap shot for developers and stake holders in order for it to go here it means it has been tested and verified production ready. if not it must get created in a issue. PROPER GITHUB BRANCHING , CREATING ISSUES , PR MUST TAKE PLACE WE ARE NOT GOOD DEVS WE ARE GREAT DEVS.
