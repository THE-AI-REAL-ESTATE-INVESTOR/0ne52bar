# Prisma Integration Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the Prisma database integration in the ONE-52 Bar application. We have successfully migrated from using local JSON files to a robust PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM.

## What's Working

### TapPass Functionality

- **Member Registration**: New TapPass members are saved directly to the database.
- **Member Retrieval**: Existing members can be retrieved by email.
- **Membership Card**: The card generation and email functions are working.
- **Visit Tracking**: Members' visits are recorded in the database.
- **Points System**: Points accumulation and membership level upgrades work automatically.

### Models Created

- **Member**: Stores member information (name, email, birthday, etc.)
- **Visit**: Records each member visit with date, amount spent, and points earned
- **Reward**: Tracks rewards earned by members
- **MenuItem**: Stores menu items with categories
- **Event**: Manages events with their details
- **EventTag**: Categorizes events
- **EventAttendee**: Tracks event attendance

## Database Structure

### Key Models

```prisma
// Member model
model Member {
  id             String         @id @default(cuid())
  memberId       String         @unique
  name           String
  email          String         @unique
  phoneNumber    String
  birthday       DateTime
  agreeToTerms   Boolean        @default(true)
  membershipLevel MembershipLevel @default(BRONZE)
  joinDate       DateTime       @default(now())
  points         Int            @default(0)
  visits         Int            @default(0)
  lastVisit      DateTime?
  createdAt      DateTime       @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime       @updatedAt
  visitHistory   Visit[]
  rewards        Reward[]
}

// Visit model
model Visit {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  member    Member   @relation(fields: [memberId], references: [id])
  memberId  String
  visitDate DateTime @default(now())
  amount    Float    @default(0)
  points    Int      @default(0)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

## Server Actions

We've created Prisma-based server actions for all key functionality:

1. **TapPass Actions** (`src/app/tappass/actions.ts`):
   - Register new members
   - Look up members by email
   - Send membership cards by email
   - Record member visits
   - Track points and manage membership levels

2. **Menu Actions** (`src/actions/menuActions.ts`):
   - Get all menu items
   - Filter items by category
   - Add, update, and delete menu items

3. **Event Actions** (`src/actions/eventActions.ts`):
   - Get all events
   - Get events by ID
   - Add, update, and delete events
   - Register attendance

## Migration Process

The migration from JSON to Prisma followed these steps:

1. Created Prisma schema with all necessary models
2. Generated Prisma client
3. Ran database migration to create tables
4. Migrated existing members from JSON to the database
5. Updated frontend code to use the new Prisma-based actions

## Local Development

For local development:

1. Use `npx prisma studio` to view and edit data in the database
2. Use `npx prisma migrate dev` when changing the schema

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. Ensure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly
2. Run `npx prisma generate` during deployment
3. Use `npx prisma migrate deploy` for production migrations

## What's New

With the Prisma integration, we've added several new features:

1. **Point System**: Automatic tracking of points based on visits
2. **Membership Levels**: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum tiers based on points
3. **Visit History**: Detailed tracking of all member visits
4. **Statistics**: Aggregated data on members, visits, and points

## Future Enhancements

Potential next steps for the database integration:

1. Add more specific reward types
2. Implement a promotional campaign system
3. Track item popularity and order history
4. Add admin reports and analytics
