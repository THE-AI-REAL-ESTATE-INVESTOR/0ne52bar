# Prisma Integration Plan

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created ts2prisma package for TypeScript-to-Prisma schema generation
- ✅ Published ts2prisma to npm
- ✅ Integrated ts2prisma into the project workflow
- ✅ Created configuration file (.prisma-ts-generator.json)
- ✅ Set up initial TypeScript interfaces and generated schema

## Current State
- We have TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/`
- We can generate Prisma schema from these interfaces
- Schema is generated at `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Watch mode is functional but has some limitations

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup (Today)
- [ ] Configure Prisma for SQLite in development environment
- [ ] Create initial migration based on generated schema
- [ ] Test database setup with Prisma Studio
- [ ] Generate Prisma client

### 2. Core Entity Implementation (Tomorrow)
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for Events
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for Business Info
- [ ] Create service layer for database operations
- [ ] Build API endpoints for these entities

### 3. Authentication Integration (Day 3)
- [ ] Connect user management to Prisma
- [ ] Implement authentication guards for admin routes
- [ ] Set up role-based permissions

### 4. Advanced Features (Day 4)
- [ ] Implement relationships (e.g., Events with Tags)
- [ ] Add full-text search capabilities
- [ ] Set up data validation with Zod
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates

### 5. Testing & Optimization (Day 5)
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for database operations
- [ ] Optimize query performance
- [ ] Implement database migrations for production
- [ ] Set up backup strategy

## Technical Approach

### Database Schema
We'll use our ts2prisma generator to maintain the schema, with these core models:
- User (authentication)
- Event (restaurant events)
- BusinessInfo (about the restaurant)
- Menu (food/drink offerings)

### Implementation Pattern
1. Define/update TypeScript interfaces
2. Generate Prisma schema using ts2prisma
3. Create migration using Prisma CLI
4. Implement service functions for each model
5. Build API endpoints that use these services
6. Connect UI components to API endpoints

### Best Practices
- Keep TypeScript interfaces as the single source of truth
- Use transactions for operations affecting multiple entities
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Follow RESTful API design principles

## Tools & Technologies
- **ts2prisma**: Generate Prisma schema from TypeScript
- **Prisma**: ORM for database operations
- **SQLite**: Development database
- **PostgreSQL**: Production database (future)
- **Next.js API Routes**: Backend API endpoints
- **React Query**: Frontend data fetching/caching
- **Zod**: Data validation

## Monitoring & Evaluation
- Track query performance
- Monitor database size and growth
- Set up error logging for database operations
- Create dashboard for database health
