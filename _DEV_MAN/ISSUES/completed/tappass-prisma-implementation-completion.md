## Current Status

The TapPass Prisma implementation is now complete with the following achievements:

1. **PostgreSQL Database**: The application now uses a PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite or in-memory storage
2. **Model Integration**: TapPass models (TapPassFormData, TapPassMember) are now included in the Prisma schema
3. **Database Migration**: Initial migration has been created and applied
4. **Automated Schema Generation**: Changes to TypeScript interfaces automatically update the Prisma schema

## Next Steps

While the database infrastructure is now in place, the following tasks remain to be completed:

1. **Server Actions Migration**: Replace in-memory actions with Prisma-backed actions
2. **Testing**: Test data persistence across server restarts
3. **Member Management**: Implement comprehensive member management features
4. **Visit Tracking**: Add visit tracking functionality
5. **Analytics**: Implement analytics and reporting

The basic infrastructure for TapPass with Prisma is now complete, but the application-level integration still needs to be finalized.
