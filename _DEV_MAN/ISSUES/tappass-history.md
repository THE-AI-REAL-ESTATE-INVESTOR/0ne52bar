### Key Commits and Changes
- 10:28:24: "Fixed member ID sequence generation and UI rendering"
- 10:29:32: "Added required lib files"
- These changes were made in the `update-tappass` branch but were reset at 10:32:30

### Branch Activity Today
1. Started with `merge-prod-dev` branch
2. Made several attempts to fix TapPass implementation:
   - Worked on `update-tappass` branch
   - Explored `restore-tappass`, `restore-working-tappass`, and `restore-tappass-changes` branches
   - Attempted fixes in `fix/tappass-implementation` branch

### Current State
- Working implementation was achieved earlier today with lookup functionality
- Changes include:
  - Member ID sequence generation fix
  - UI rendering improvements
  - Required library files addition

### Branch Information
1. `merge-prod-dev`:
   - Contains documentation and implementation patterns
   - Has diverged from remote (1 local vs 26 remote commits)

2. `update-tappass`:
   - Contains recent fixes for member ID and UI
   - Had working implementation before recent resets

3. `restore-tappass-changes`:
   - Contains variations of the implementation
   - Related to the working version

4. `fix/tappass-implementation`:

## Next Steps
1. Review the changes from 10:28:24 that had the working implementation
2. Compare with current state to identify what was lost
3. Consider creating a new branch from that point to restore the working version

## Notes
- The working implementation included Prisma integration
- UI rendering and member ID sequence generation were key components
- Multiple branches contain different versions of the implementation
- Recent resets and branch switches may have affected the working state
