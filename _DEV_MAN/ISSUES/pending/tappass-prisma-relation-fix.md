# TapPass Prisma Relation Fix

## Definitive Issue (From Git Logs)

The working version (commit f80905c) had:
```typescript
return db.member.findFirst({
  where: whereClause,
  include: {
    visits: {
      orderBy: {
        visitDate: 'desc',
      },
      take: 5,
    },
  },
});
```

Recent changes (commit 7ac49f4) broke this by:
1. Switching from `db` to `prisma` client inconsistently
2. Removing the `include` statement in the `find` method
3. Mixing usage of `visits` and `visitHistory` relations

## Non-Breaking Solution

1. **Revert Member Service Query to Working Version**:
```typescript
async find({ email, phoneNumber, memberId }: FindMemberParams) {
  if (!email && !phoneNumber && !memberId) {
    throw new Error('At least one search parameter is required');
  }

  const whereClause: Prisma.MemberWhereInput = {};
  if (email) whereClause.email = email;
  if (phoneNumber) whereClause.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
  if (memberId) whereClause.memberId = memberId;

  return db.member.findFirst({
    where: whereClause,
    include: {
      visits: {
        orderBy: {
          visitDate: 'desc',
        },
        take: 5,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

2. **Keep Existing Database Client**:
- Continue using `db` from `./index` as it was working before
- Do not switch to `prisma` client yet as it requires more testing

3. **Fix Type Definitions**:
```typescript
import { MembershipLevel, type Prisma } from '@prisma/client';
import { db } from './index';

interface FindMemberParams {
  email?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  memberId?: string;
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Revert the member service query to the working version
2. Remove mixed client usage (stick with `db`)
3. Keep existing type definitions that were working
4. No schema changes needed - use existing relations

## Why This Solution is Non-Breaking

1. Uses the exact code structure that was working before
2. Makes no changes to database schema
3. Maintains existing client usage patterns
4. Preserves working type definitions
5. No migration or data changes required

## Testing Verification

1. Member lookup should work with:
   - Email search
   - Phone search
   - Member ID search
2. Visit history should display correctly
3. Points system should continue working
4. No build errors or type mismatches

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Member lookup works exactly as it did before
- [ ] Visit history displays with proper ordering
- [ ] No type errors in build
- [ ] No database changes required
- [ ] Maintains backward compatibility

## Next Steps (After Verification)

1. Document the working query pattern
2. Plan future client standardization
3. Consider type improvements in a separate PR
4. Add tests to prevent regression
