# To Delete Directory

This directory contains files that have been migrated to the consolidated implementation and are scheduled for deletion after verification.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to:

1. Provide a temporary storage location for files that have been migrated
2. Allow for verification that all functionality has been preserved
3. Provide a safety net in case of issues with the consolidated implementation
4. Facilitate a clean removal process once verification is complete

## Process

1. Files are moved to this directory after migration
2. Verification is performed to ensure all functionality is preserved
3. If verification is successful, files are deleted
4. If verification fails, files can be restored to their original location
