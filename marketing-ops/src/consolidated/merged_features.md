## Type System Consolidation

The type system has been consolidated into three main categories:

1. **Base Types** (`base.ts`)
   - Core marketing campaign types
   - Zod validation schemas
   - Type guards

2. **App Types** (`app.ts`)
   - App-specific parameters
   - App metrics
   - Revenue projections
   - Extended marketing features

3. **Excel Types** (`excel.ts`)
   - Excel styling
   - Cell configuration
   - Worksheet configuration
   - Generation data

All types are now:
- Fully documented with JSDoc comments
- Validated with Zod schemas
- Protected with type guards
- Organized in a modular structure
- Ready for integration with implementations
