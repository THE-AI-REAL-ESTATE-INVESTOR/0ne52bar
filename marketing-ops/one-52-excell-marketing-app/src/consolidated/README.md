## Separation of Concerns

The consolidated implementation is organized into four main components:

1. **one52bar-current**: Core marketing operations functionality
   - Standard marketing campaign calculations
   - Revenue projections
   - Cost analysis
   - Break-even calculations

2. **one52bar-direct-mail**: Direct mail marketing functionality
   - Postcard campaign calculations
   - Stamp cost analysis
   - Mailing list management
   - Response rate tracking

3. **one52bar-app**: App-specific marketing functionality
   - App signup metrics
   - Push notification costs
   - Organic growth tracking
   - App-specific revenue projections

4. **shared**: Common functionality used across all implementations
   - Type definitions
   - Utility functions
   - Configuration
   - Excel generation logic

## Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation

1. **Identify the most complete version**
   - Based on file sizes and line counts, the Excel4Node implementation appears to be the most complete (12KB, 279 lines)
   - The ExcelJS implementation is more modern but smaller (3.1KB, 86 lines)
   - The JavaScript implementation has unique features (289 lines)
   - The app marketing calculator has extensive functionality (20KB, 480 lines)

2. **Create directory structure**
   ```
   consolidated/
   ├── one52bar-current/
   │   ├── src/
   │   │   ├── calculations/    # Core marketing calculations
   │   │   └── excel/           # Excel generation for current
   │   ├── tests/               # Test files
   │   └── docs/                # Documentation
   ├── one52bar-direct-mail/
   │   ├── src/
   │   │   ├── calculations/    # Direct mail calculations
   │   │   └── excel/           # Excel generation for direct mail
   │   ├── tests/               # Test files
   │   └── docs/                # Documentation
   ├── one52bar-app/
   │   ├── src/
   │   │   ├── calculations/    # App-specific calculations
   │   │   └── excel/           # Excel generation for app
   │   ├── tests/               # Test files
   │   └── docs/                # Documentation
   └── shared/
       ├── types/               # Combined type definitions
       ├── config/              # Configuration and constants
       ├── utils/               # Utility functions
       └── excel/               # Common Excel generation logic
   ```

3. **Set up tracking mechanism**
   - Create a `merged_features.md` file to track which features have been migrated
   - Create a `to_delete` directory for files that have been safely merged

### Phase 2: Type System Consolidation

1. **Analyze all type definitions**
   - Compare types from ExcelJS, Excel4Node, and legacy implementations
   - Identify any unique types from each implementation
   - Create a comprehensive type system that includes all necessary types

2. **Create consolidated type files**
   - `shared/types/campaign.ts` - Campaign parameters and data structures
   - `shared/types/calculations.ts` - Calculation results and metrics
   - `shared/types/excel.ts` - Excel-specific types
   - `shared/types/index.ts` - Type exports

3. **Validate type coverage**
   - Ensure all types from previous implementations are included
   - Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
   - Create type guards for runtime validation

### Phase 3: Business Logic Consolidation

1. **Extract calculation logic**
   - Identify all calculation functions from each implementation
   - Create unified calculation modules for each concern
   - Ensure all formulas and business rules are preserved

2. **Consolidate app parameters**
   - Combine all app parameters from different implementations
   - Organize by category (marketing, operations, finance)
   - Add validation and documentation

3. **Implement feature flags**
   - Add configuration options to enable/disable features
   - Ensure backward compatibility with previous implementations

### Phase 4: Excel Generation Consolidation

1. **Choose primary Excel library**
   - ExcelJS offers more modern features and better TypeScript support
   - Create abstraction layer to support both ExcelJS and Excel4Node if needed

2. **Implement unified Excel generation**
   - Create a modular Excel generation system
   - Support all worksheet types from previous implementations
   - Preserve all styling and formatting options

3. **Add migration utilities**
   - Create tools to convert between different Excel formats
   - Ensure data can be migrated from old to new format

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Create test suite**
   - Test each component individually
   - Test integration between components
   - Compare output with previous implementations

2. **Validate feature parity**
   - Ensure all features from previous implementations are working
   - Document any differences or improvements

3. **Performance testing**
   - Compare performance with previous implementations
   - Optimize where necessary

### Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup

1. **Update documentation**
   - Document the consolidated implementation
   - Create migration guides for users of previous versions
   - Update usage instructions

2. **Move merged files to to_delete**
   - Only after thorough testing and validation
   - Keep a record of what has been merged

3. **Final review**
   - Ensure no functionality has been lost
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Check documentation completeness
